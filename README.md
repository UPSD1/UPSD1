# Hey, I'm David, an AI Researcher 👋

A bit about me, from 2023 to 2025, I spent two years at Cornell University working with [Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/) on NLP research.

Right now, I'm splitting my time between research and building [Meridius], a group of strong minds working on sound research, maximizing impact and deploying production systems.

## What I'm building

**[LexLens](https://lexlens.app)** — Interpretable legal AI with constitutional safety (95% accuracy).

**[Meetviro](https://meetviro.com/)** — An autonomous meeting agent, launching in January. 1000+ people waiting.

**Ingenium** — E-learning platform where AI actually helps you learn, not just gives you answers.

## Background

My thesis explored how search-augmented RL can make legal AI less of a mystery box through causal inference and an AI safety framework. I defended my MS in September 2025.

## Research
- 🎓 MS Computer Science, Cornell University (2025)
- 📄 Thesis: [Interpretable Legal Reasoning with Search-Augmented RL]
- 👨‍🏫 Advised by [Prof. Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/) and [Emmad Manzoor](https://emaadmanzoor.com/) 

## Tech Focus
RL post-training • Safety systems • Production ML • Interpretability/Explainability • Real-time systems • LLMs & more
